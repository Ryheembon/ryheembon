## Hi there 👋

## Hi there 👋

I'm **Ryheem**, aka **The One**, a curious mind crafting code with purpose and heart.  
I’m a **technical support pro turned software craftsman**, bridging the worlds of networks, clouds, and clean UI.

- 🔭 I’m currently building:
  - A **SaaS app** for reviewing books and research papers with AI  
  - A mood-based **playlist generator** using React, Python, and the Spotify API  
  - My **career in cloud, networking, and server engineering**

- 🌱 Always learning:
  - **Django REST Framework**, **React.js**, and how to **ship production-ready full-stack apps**  
  - Automation, orchestration, and dev wizardry with **Ansible, Linux, and Azure**

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Projects that combine creativity + functionality  
  - Tools that solve real-world problems for underserved communities

- ⚡ Fun facts:
  - I write romantic poems for TikTok 💘  
  - I play piano when my code compiles without errors 🎹  
  - I document everything in Obsidian like a tech monk in the cloud temple 📜☁️

- 💬 Let’s talk about:
  - Cloud architecture, network engineering, Django, or just how wild tech is becoming
